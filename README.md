# chatgpt-extension-python

This is an extension for the ChatGPT platform using the OpenAI API.

Since i work a lot with vscode which is lonely consume memory, i see that is more consumable to open a browser and launch a session or to use a vscode extension.

So i made this to stage in help !

## Usage:

To use just clone the repository and launch the command:

```bash
./chatgpt --help
```
to see the help prompt.

## Example:

- Direct mode:

Add a new api-key
```
./chatgpt -nak "<your-api-key>"
```

Send prompt to ChatGPT
```
./chatgpt -p "<your-prompt-here>"
```

- Interactive mode:
```
./chatgpt
```
