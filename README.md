# chatgpt-extension-python
This is an extension for the ChatGPT platform using the OpenAI API.

Since i work a lot with vscode which is lonely consume memory, i see that is more consumable to open a browser and launch a session.

So i made this to stage in help !

To use just clone the repository and launch the command:

```bash
./chatgpt --help
```
and see the help prompt.

> Take care . . :-)
